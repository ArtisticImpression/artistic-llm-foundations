# Open vs Proprietary AI

Not all AI should be open. Not all AI should be closed.

Open resources:
- Documentation
- Creative frameworks
- Public experiments

Protected resources:
- Core models
- Business logic
- Product infrastructure

This balance enables long-term innovation without exploitation.
