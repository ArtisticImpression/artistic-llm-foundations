# Artistic LLM Foundations

This repository contains foundational thinking, notes, and experiments from **Artistic Impression** around **Large Language Models (LLMs), creativity, culture, and human-centered intelligence**.

Rather than focusing on benchmarks or model hype, this repository documents how we think about building **useful, responsible, and creative AI systems** that integrate with real human workflows.

## Purpose

- Explore how LLMs can support creativity, reasoning, and design
- Document patterns for human-first AI systems
- Share open knowledge without exposing proprietary technology
- Establish long-term research and product foundations

This repository is **intentionally conceptual and experimental**.
